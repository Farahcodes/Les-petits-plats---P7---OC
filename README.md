## Objective
My mission: to implement a search algorithm that allows the user to quickly access a recipe corresponding to the user's request among recipes in the database.
 ## Use case
 The search algorithm needs to be able to filter recipes along two axes: a main search bar to search for words or groups of letters in the title, ingredients, or description, and a search by keywords in ingredients, utensils, or appliances.
 ## Key code concepts
 Two different search alogirthms have been implemented and tested:
+ Native Loops: iterating through each recipe in the database and checking if the search criteria matches any of the recipe's title, ingredient list or description.
+ Functional programming with Array methods: involves using methods like Filter to filter the recipes based on the search criteria or selected tags
